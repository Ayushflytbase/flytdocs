.. _flytsim_prerequisites: 

Prerequisites
=============

Linux
-----

Visit the `Docker installation guide <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms>`_ and make sure your flavour of Linux is supported by Docker. If you are running anything apart from Ubuntu, please follow the above guide and install docker in your machine. **For Ubuntu users, we have an installation script**, details of which are in :ref:`setup <flytsim_setup_linux>` section. It is preferable if you use Ubuntu 14.04 or above.
 
Windows
-------

Visit installation guide for `Docker-for-Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>`_ and install it if it is supported by your Windows OS. Typically 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education support the newer *Docker-for-Windows*. To know more about it, click `here <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install>`__. Currently we DO NOT support `Docker Toolbox (legacy) <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>`__ and have no plan to do it in near future.
 
MacOS
-----

Visit installation guide for `Docker-for-Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>`_ and install it if it is supported by your Mac OS. Typically OS X El Capitan 10.11 and newer macOS releases support the newer *Docker-for-Mac*. To know more about it, click `here <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install>`__. Currently we DO NOT support `Docker Toolbox (legacy) <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/>`__ and have no plan to do it in near future.
 
.. warning:: In MacOS we could not enable GUI support from within Docker, which means if you are keen on having 3D GUI Gazebo based environment, then please use Linux or Windows.
