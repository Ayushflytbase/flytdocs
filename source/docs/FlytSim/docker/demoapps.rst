Demoapps
--------

Once you have got your FlytSim activated, with `FlytConsole <http://localhost/flytconsole>`_ showing a valid Connection status, you are good to go ahead with trying some of our inbuilt sample apps. 

Open up FlytConsole and go to its GCS widget. Try setting Waypoints, and once satisfied click on Execute button to make the drone start executing the mission.

Open up a shell inside the container by triggering :ref:`openshell <flytsim_shell>` script. Once inside the container, try running `cpp demo app <http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/OnboardCPP.html#write-onboard-cpp>`_ or `python demo app <http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/OnboardPython.html#write-onboard-python>`_.

.. note:: Instead of opening a shell, you can use the integrated web-based IDE now available with FlytSim Docker. :ref:`Click here <flytsim_ide>` to know more.
