Safety Guidelines
=================

* Please go through the :ref:`essentials<essentials>` before you proceed. The on-field operations team should be aware of them.
* Most of the operations with FlytOS are fully or semi autonomous. Offboard switch is the Manual Override. Always have a dedicated manual pilot ready to take control in case of emergencies.
* Before switching to offboard mode it is always a good practice to check if manual and position hold modes are working.
* FlytPOD connected to mobile phone hotspot may not give long range. Use powerful ground routers with high gain antennas for long range operations. If you want to use radio telemetry modules then check the peripherals.
* Always use external GPS-MAG module for stable yaw performance. Internal compass suffers a lot of interference.
* FlytOS comes with automatic update functionality. We keep pushing lot of security and new feature updates. FlytOS will download and install updates when device is connected to internet. It is good practise to connect your drone to internet once a week at least.
* Please follow rules and regulations laid down by your local authority.
