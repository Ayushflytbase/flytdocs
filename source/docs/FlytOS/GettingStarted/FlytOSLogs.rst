Startup Logs

* The startup log contains a lot of important startup related events including any errors in updates or installation.

* Viewing startup logs in browser helps debug any startup related issues in real time.

* Logs can be downloaded one at a time or in groups.
* Press the Autopilot tab to refresh the log list.
* To Download individually, click on the Download Icon next to the log file you want to download. This will download the log file to SBC.
* Alternatively you can select the logs you want to download and click on bulk download to download them all to SBC one after the other.
* Clicking on the download icon after download is complete allows you to download the log from SBC, locally to device.
* In case you want to stop an ongoing download, click the cross icon beside log file currently being downloaded.

.. note:: Downloading logs from autopilot is significantly faster when the autopilot is connected to SBC through USB as compared to telemetry.

* Successfully downloaded autopilot logs will be automatically uploaded to cloud. They can be accessed and downloaded through your account at |my_flytbase_link|.
