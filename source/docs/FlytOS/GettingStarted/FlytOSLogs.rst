Autopilot Logs
==============

.. warning:: Viewing and downloading autopilot logs can take place only when the drone is not armed. Please do not arm the drone in the process of log viewing and downloading.

* Autopilot logs generated by APM and PX4 are instrumental in after-flight analysis.

* Through FlytOS you can download autopilot logs to SBC. After a log is successfully downloaded to SBC, you can download it locally to any other device over your local network. FlytOS also provides upload of logs to cloud for remote downloading.

* Logs can be downloaded one at a time or in groups.
* Press the Autopilot tab to refresh the log list.
* To download individually, click on the GET Icon next to the log file you want to download. This will download the log file to SBC.
* Alternatively you can select the logs you want to download and click on bulk download to download them all to SBC one after the other.
* You can download the logs locally to any device by clicking on download after the logs are succesfully downloaded on your SBC.
* In case you want to stop an ongoing download, click the cross icon beside log file currently being downloaded. Please wait until you are prompted that cancellation is complete.

.. note:: Downloading logs from autopilot is significantly faster when the autopilot is connected to SBC through USB rather than telemetry.

* Successfully downloaded autopilot logs will be automatically uploaded to cloud on every startup of FlytOS. They can be accessed and downloaded through your account at |my_flytbase_link|.
