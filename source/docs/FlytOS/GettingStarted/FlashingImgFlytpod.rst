   * Mac OS- launch a terminal and execute the following command

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ md5 <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

5. Compare the MD5 Hash generated to *MD5 Hash* mentioned in the |flytos_dl_link| download page.
6. Uncompress/extract the downloaded image:

   * Linux- launch a terminal and execute the following command

     .. code-block:: bash

         gunzip <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

   * Windows- download and install 7-zip from `here <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_. Extract downloaded image using 7-zip.
   * Mac OS- launch a terminal and execute the following command

     .. code-block:: bash

         gunzip <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

7. Uncompressed size of image is about 8.5GBs.

Write image to SD/eMMC Card and partition expansion:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. 1. We recommend using a 32 GB SD Card, but a 16 GB card would work fine too.
.. 2. Format the micro SD Card.
.. 3. Follow `this <http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroid_flashing_tools>`_ guide to install the image on ODROID-XU4â€™s SD/eMMC card.


.. **Expanding SD Card partition:**

.. Since the image is only around 8.5 GBs, the rest of the SD Card would have unallocated memory. Follow `this guide <http://elinux.org/RPi_Resize_Flash_Partitions>`_ to expand the partition to the maximum possible size to utilize all memory.

We have created a video tutorial for Linux and Mac OS users, to help flash FlytOS Linux Image on their SD/eMMC cards and then expand the partition. Windows users can refer `this guide <http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroid_flashing_tools>`_ for writing image and Windows Disk Management Utility to expand the SD/eMMC card.

.. warning:: Since the image is of only around 8.5 GBs, the rest of the SD/eMMC Card would have unallocated memory. DO NOT forget to expand SD/eMMC card partition.
