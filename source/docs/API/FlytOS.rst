About FlytOS
============

FlytOS is the software framework of Flyt which provides a language for the drone developers to talk to their drones. It is based on ROS (Robot Operating System) and Linux making it an ideal platform for research and commercial drone applications.

FlytOS interacts with the drone autopilot (flight stack) using MAVLink protocol and exposes high level FlytAPIs in ROS, CPP, Python, REST and Websocket. These rich set of APIs allow for easy development of onboard business logic as well as remote monitoring and control through web and mobile apps.

The apps developed with FlytAPIs can talk to PX4 flight stack as well as can be tested in a virtual ROS/Gazebo environment using FlytSim.
