.. First principles:

.. FlytPOD can be powered through main power connector only. ESC can not supply power to flytpod. However on back io panel pins marked with '+' are given for powering payloads with ESC 5V output. e.g. RC receiver, lidar, etc.

Safety Guidelines
=================



.. 1 Read the first principles of flyt. The on-field operations team should be aware of them.
.. 2 Do not draw power from flytpod for any payload unless and until mentioned specifically in Peripherals.
.. 3 Most of the operations with Flyt are fully or semi autonomous. Offboard switch is the Manual Override. Always have a dedicated manual pilot ready to take control in case of emergency.
.. 4 Please follow rules and regulations laid down by your local authority.
.. 5 During flying it is always a good practise to check first, if manual and position hold modes are working, before your switch to offboard mode.
.. 6 Please dont try to dismantle the flytPOD. You might not be able to put the things back in order and might cause the vibration dampening mechanism to fail. 
.. 7 Flytpod connected to mobile phone hotspot may not give long range. Use powerful ground routers with high gain antennas for long range operations. If you want to use radio telemetry modules then check peripherals.
.. 8 Do not subject FlytPOD to water, dust, prolonged heat. 
.. 9 Always use external GPS-MAG module for stable yaw performance. Internal compass suffers a lot of interference.
.. 10 Always keep FlytPOD updated. We are adding lot of security and safety modules and will be continuously releasing updates.
