2. LIDAR-Lite

    a) The Garmin / PulsedLight LIDAR-Lite rangefinder is a low-cost optical distance measurement solution with a 40m range under most operating conditions, low power consumption, and small form factor. For more information on LIDAR-Lite click `here <http://www.lightware.co.za>`_.
    b) **Parameter:** SENS_EN_LL40LS
    c) **Connection diagram:** Connecting to FlytPOD via PWM

Air Speed Sensor
----------------

1. MS4525

    a) The HK Pilot32 digital differential airspeed sensor is the next generation of sensors, it uses digital data instead of an analog voltage signal. Analog signals are subject to induction and noise problems, especially in longer wires. Causing error and false data, the new Digital airspeed indicator fixes all of these issues.
    b) **Connection diagram:** Connecting to FlytPOD via I2C
